# AwayGateIoT
AwayGateIoT is a project devoploped to creata a automated gate system that is cost exffective and flexable to work in with and intergrate with a home autiomation network 

The hardware for this project is has been designed around the node MCU microcontroller platform, that makes use of the ESP32 and its wifi capibilities. This is thaen compines with  a H bridge setup to drive DC linier acuators, However , adaptations can be made to drive other DC Motors  

The software/firmware aspects are to be withheld, however,  of home assistant and its work in in's with the ESP32 platofrm is a good starting point 

 The current intteration of the device has the following fetures  
 
 * node mcu socket
 * x2 BTS 7960 half brige drivers (rated 45Amp RMS) 
 * Current  readings 
 * regulator 24-> 5v(MCU Power)
